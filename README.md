# MemoryPulse
MemoryPulse is ocketMine-MP plugin designed to dynamically optimize server memory and packet handling. It simulates low-level memory management techniques (inspired by C/C++ and Assembly) within the constraints of PHP, providing automatic garbage collection, dynamic buffer sizing, and packet optimization based on real-time server conditions.
